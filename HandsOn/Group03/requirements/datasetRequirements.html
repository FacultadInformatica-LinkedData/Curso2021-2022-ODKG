        <h1>Dataset Requirements, Group 03</h1>
        <hr/>

        <h2>Requirement R1: Data are in the smart cities domain</h2>
        <p>Our dataset gathers data from different smart solar trash bins all over Madrid, displaying their location, availavility,
        the type of waste they contains, and the capacity of each one. Since the data collected in this dataset can be used in order to manage the waste of the cities, improving the quality of live, this project is included in the smart cities domain.</p>
        
        <h2>Requirement R2: Data are available as a CSV file</h2>
        <p>Data is stored on a CSV file.</p>
        
        <h2>Requirement R3: Data have an open license so it can be published</h2>
        <p>The data has an open license, allowing its use either for commercial or non commercial purposes, as mencioned in https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.400a817358ce98c34e937436a8a409a0/?vgnextoid=b4c412b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD</p>
        
        <h2>Requirement R4: Data can be easily linked with real-world entities</h2>
        <p>The CSV file contains one column with the complete adress of each trash bin, and another two with their coordinates. The geographical location of each trash bin can be used to link our entities with the same entities in other datasets, since if one single bin exists in two different datasets, they both should have the same coordinates, and the same the other way around. Finally, there is available an RDF file containing different links and resources to access this data via open data techniques.</p>

        <h2>Requirement R5: Documentation exists for the data</h2>
        <p>The data owner: Dirección General de Servicios de Limpieza y Residuos, Subdirección General de Limpieza y Equipamientos from the 
        Área de Gobierno de Medio Ambiente y Movilidad from the Madrid municipality provides, in the https://datos.madrid.es/portal domain a PDF document marked as "Associated Documentation", which explains (among other characteristics) the description of the dataset and its structure, with another description provided for each column individually.</p>

        <h2>Requirement R6: Data can come from multiple sources</h2>
        <p>Since all data has been gathered by only one public organism, data only comes from one single public source.</p>
