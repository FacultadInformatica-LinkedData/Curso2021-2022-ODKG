<p>We plan to develop an app that filter events in Madrid based on location, day, price, kind, etc.</p>
 
<p>The interface will consist on some input fields that the user must fill to filter events. </p>
<p>When the user press a search button, that filters will be appied and events will show with general information such as price or timestamp.</p>
<p>If the user selects an event then the app will show more specific information about the event (map with location of the event, brief description, price, timestamp, etc).</p>

<p>The interface will be fancy, simple and easy to understand.
