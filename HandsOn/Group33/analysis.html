  <h3>Resource naming strategy examples:</h3>
  <ul>
    Due to the fact that our data concerns only one topic (e-scooter) and is small in itself, we will use a hash (#) to access resources.
    The URI domain is http://e-scooter.com because it better reflects the theme of our application.
    <p>Ontological path:</p>
    <li>Class: http://e-scooter.com/ontology#{className}</li>
    <li>Property: http://e-scooter.com/ontology#{propertyName}</li>
    <li>Individuals: 
      <ul>
